  <p class="site-description">
    Perdictions, Reveries, Possibilities and Kaleidoscope? Just a joke. prpk.com is only a storyless domain name registered by my father 20 years ago, rolling his keyboard, when the storage of 4-letter domain names was in an emergency. It could be something like nwsc.com or eodk.com.

Of course, none of these sites is available, because they came from me rolling my keyboard either.

There are great sites like xkcd.com, and believe it or not, I discovered it through rolling my keyboard when I was only 12!

                <p>A pen, a miracle, was created by the god, and discarded in the world through a careless wave. Everyone who picked the pen would receive three chances to draw something and wish it to be true.</p>
<p>The pen fell to the ground, in the shape of an ordinary sign pen, lying in an ordinary shop with dozens of students. The one who came across the pen was a naive boy. He luckily picked the pen out from thousands of similar objects and drew a line on a flat piece of paper. Astonishingly, the line jumped out from the page, floated in the air, and began to swim like a black snake. The boy was shocked, with his mouse in an O shape and saliva on his jaw. He secretly picked up the pen and hurried home without even paying the price.</p>
<p>At night, while the moon was hanging in the sky high, the boy picked up his pen, opened his homework, and charming: “grand, magical, wishing pen, making my homework being done.” The pen lay on the blank workbook, making nothing except a humming sound, seemingly refusing the stupid wish. The boy took another workbook from piles of different books, charming with his soft, pride sound, but following with nothing again.</p>
<p>The boy sat in front of his desk with disappointment. He hesitated for a moment, and finally took out a piece of paper, drawing with his shaking, furious hand. He draws a gray box, a bottle of ink, and piles of finished workbooks in front of the gray box. The box then jumped out of the page and appeared in the boy’s hand. The boy picked up a page and stuffed it inside the box. Lines of different words and sentences appeared on the page, following the with a horrible, cracking sound. The boy, astonished by the miracle of the small, powerful pen, plugged all of his unfinished homework into the small box and waited anxiously until all the homework was done.</p>
<p>The next day, the boy went to school with tons of books and papers, handing them to the teacher with a proud smile. Ignoring his classmates’ unbelieving discussion and the teacher’s wide-opening eyes, he put all his homework on the platform. With a satisfied smile, the teacher opened the first assignment, but then a roar of extreme anger pulled the boy back from his reverie. Unbelievably, the boy opened the workbook and found out that all the words were unrecognizable.</p>
<p>The boy went back home with a depressed heart. He took out the pen and drew a huge cross on the box. The cross jumped out, as the pen jumped into the air, turned into ashes, and faded in the falling sun. The boy smashed the box on the ground, crying as the pen left him forever.</p>
