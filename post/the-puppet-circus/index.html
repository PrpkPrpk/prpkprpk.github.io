    Perdictions, Reveries, Possibilities and Kaleidoscope? Just a joke. prpk.com is only a storyless domain name registered by my father 20 years ago, rolling his keyboard, when the storage of 4-letter domain names was in an emergency. It could be something like nwsc.com or eodk.com.

Of course, none of these sites is available, because they came from me rolling my keyboard either.

There are great sites like xkcd.com, and believe it or not, I discovered it through rolling my keyboard when I was only 12!

                <p>There was a kid who lost in the woods. “Do not go to the circus!” So said the note written in red words, pasted on the boy’s bedside cupboard.</p>
<p>“Emm……Does it mean to the circus recently arrived at the city?” The boy was confused. Next to the note, a ticket lying on the cupboard, the boy stood up and picked up the ticket.</p>
<p>“Weird. I never purchase red ink for my pen.” Although feeling strange, the boy still picked up the ticket and put it into his pocket. “I have to go to the circus to meet my friends.” He thought as he left the room, leaving the note behind his thought.</p>
<p>It was a sunny, warm afternoon, and we could easily notice a huge, red tent was standing at the end of the rugged, country road, against the mountain filling with trees and other plantation. The boy was rushing across piles of dried soil, splitting the ash and dust onto his trousers. He held the ticket in hand, breathing, and waving his hands, as if his friends were at the tent, even not noticing his trousers turned yellow. Within only a few minutes, he arrived at the tent.</p>
<p>The boy looked around. “It is weird. Why there is no one here? It is always crowded with people cars.” He could nebulously recollect his memory last week, when the school was over, children were crowded in the tent, yawling. Starring at the huge gate, the boy shouted again and again, but only silence answered him. He could even hear the droning sun pouring the power of heat to his sweating body.</p>
<p>Wondering round and round, he finally took out the ticket. He never really looked at the ticket. It was a beautiful piece of black cardboard with a big circus logo and a gold embossed pattern. The boy turned the ticket over, and to his surprise, there was only ten: Please do not visit the circus if you are alone.</p>
<p>The boy gave a strange cry and shook off the ticket like a hot potato. All of the sudden, the light around the giant tent vanished, and fog approached as if the sun had never existed. Logs crushed on each other, like thunders, combining with the sound of leaves shuffling across the misted air. The boy panickily ran forward, only to see a pine tree blocking his path. He turned quickly to the left, but soon more and more trees emerged from the mist. “Strange, it doesn’t seem to be a forest around the circus. “ The tree frightened the boy, but they didn’t prevent him from hurrying in the endless forest.</p>
<p>The mist flew past the boy like trains filling with ghosts, branches squeaked under the boy’s feet, and he, finally, went exhausted and collapsed in the weeds. The day was getting darker, and trees seemed to circling his body, trying to take control to this unlucky prisoner. The boy opened his eyes with difficulty: a familiar footprint appeared before his eyes. He despaired: it turned out that he had never run even only a single step. Still, the boy was lifting his hands, trying to move forward, but, miserably, he discovered that he could not control his body anymore.</p>
<p>Somehow, he seemed to hear a pungent sound whispering in his ear: “There are so many people who came to see the show alone. Don’t be afraid, and you are not the only one.”The boy lost his conscious in the endless maze of forest in the circus.</p>
<p>A few days later, the circus left the mountain town. At the last show, some people, saw some familiar faces, on the magnificent stage.</p>
